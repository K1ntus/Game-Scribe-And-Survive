# GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT: *Scribe & Survive* (Rev 4.0)

**Working Title:** Scribe & Survive
**Genre:** Rhythm-Action Co-op Chaos
**Setting:** 8th Century Frankish Empire (Carolingian Renaissance)
**Platform:** PC / Console
**Target Audience:** Fans of *Crypt of the NecroDancer* (Rhythm), *Overcooked* (Chaos), and *Magicka* (Friendly Fire).

---

## 1. Executive Summary
**Scribe & Survive** is a local co-op game where 1-4 players defend a monastery. The gameplay fuses rhythm-based inputs with physics-based chaos.

The goal is to transcribe knowledge before the Vikings burn it. Unlike traditional class-based games, roles are fluid: **You are what you hold.** One player holds **The Codex** (The Scribe) to play the rhythm minigame, while others hold **Hammers/Torches** to defend them.

The Twist: **The Beat is Law.** Every action—moving, hitting, or writing—must be synced to the music. Missing the beat doesn't just lower your score; it causes your character to stumble, drop items, and create physical hazards that doom your team.

---

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

The game runs on a strict **Global BPM (Beats Per Minute)**.

### A. The Objective
Complete the transcription of the Codex before Sunrise (Time Limit) or before the Vikings destroy the Monastery (Health).

### B. The Rhythm Law (Strict Input)
There is no audio quantization (lag). We use **Input Validation**.
*   **The Grace Window:** Actions are only accepted if input is within ±0.15s of the beat.
*   **Success:** The action fires immediately. The sound effect acts as a musical "sweetener" (Snare/Clap).
*   **Failure (The Whiff):**
    *   **Movement:** Player "Stumbles" (hops on one foot). Move distance = 0.
    *   **Combat:** Player "Flails" (off-balance swing). Damage = 0.
    *   **Carrying Item:** **"Butterfingers."** The item is instantly dropped (See Section 4: Physics).

---

## 3. The Fluid Class System (Item-Based Roles)

There is no character select screen. Roles are defined dynamically by the object currently held.

### 1. The Scribe (Holding *The Codex*)
*   **Role:** The VIP. The only player who generates progress.
*   **Movement:** WASD (On Beat). The Scribe is mobile and must run to safe zones.
*   **Action (Write Mode):**
    *   Hold Trigger (L2/Shift) to **ROOT** in place.
    *   While rooted, a Rhythm UI appears (Arrows/Face Buttons). Hitting notes fills the "Knowledge Bar."
    *   *Constraint:* Can only write while standing in **Light**.
*   **Defense:** "Ink Dash." Costs Ink Resource. A rapid dash (invulnerable frames) to escape encirclement.

### 2. The Defender (Holding *Weapons*)
*   **Role:** Crowd Control.
*   **Weapons:** Hammers, Shields, Benches.
*   **Action:**
    *   **Attack:** directional hit on the beat.
    *   **Shove:** Push Vikings (or the Scribe) out of the way.

### 3. The Illuminator (Holding *The Torch*)
*   **Role:** Support & Metronome Maintenance.
*   **Action:** Relights wall sconces.
*   **Passive:** Creates a mobile radius of light. If the Scribe stands near the Illuminator, they can write anywhere (even in dark corners).

## 4. Physics & "The Butterfingers" System

Connecting Rhythm failure to World Chaos.

### 1. Dropped Items (The Consequence of Missed Beats)
If a player attempts to Move, Throw, or Dash off-beat while holding an item, they drop it.
*   **Ink Pot Drops:** Smashes instantly. Creates a **Slick Zone**.
    *   *Effect:* Players/Vikings moving through it slide uncontrollably (friction removed).
*   **The Codex Drops:** Falls open on the floor.
    *   *Effect:* Becomes a **Trip Hazard**. Anyone sprinting over it stumbles.
    *   *Risk:* If a Viking steps on the fallen Codex, Game Over.

### 2. The "Trip" vs. "Ragdoll"
*   **The Stumble (Missed Beat):** Short animation (0.5s). Disrupted flow, but quick recovery.
*   **The Ragdoll (Heavy Impact):** Caused by Viking hits or sprinting into a wall/obstacle. Full loss of control for 2.0s.

---

## 5. Chaos Management

### 1. The Light Mechanic
*   **Rule:** The Scribe cannot write in the dark (too panicked).
*   **Darkness:**
    *   Wall sconces can be blown out by wind or extinguished by Vikings.
    *   When dark, the **Visual Metronome** (pulsing edges of the screen) fades. Players must rely on Audio only.
*   **Strategy:** The Illuminator must act as a "Human Lighthouse" for the Scribe when the room goes dark.

### 2. The "Hot Potato" Recovery
Since roles are item-based, the team must adapt to failure.
*   *Scenario:* The Scribe gets hit by a Viking and Ragdolls. The Codex flies across the room.
*   *Recovery:* A Defender must stop fighting, dash over, pick up the Codex (becoming the new Scribe), and find a light source to continue writing. The former Scribe wakes up, grabs a hammer, and joins the fight.

## 6. Visuals & Audio Style

### Audio: The "Backing Track" Safety Net
*   **Layer 1 (The Grid):** A persistent, unshakeable drum/bass beat. This *never* drops out, ensuring players always have a reference.
*   **Layer 2 (Player Input):** Successful hits/steps play musical notes that harmonize with the Grid.
*   **Layer 3 (Failure):** Missed beats play a "dull thud" or "string snap," serving as negative audio feedback without ruining the song's tempo.

### Visuals: Diegetic UI
*   **The Codex:** The "Health Bar" is the condition of the book. As it takes damage, pages tear.
*   **The Ink:** The "Ammo" for writing. The Scribe must occasionally run to an Ink Well to refill their quill.
*   **Enemy Tells:** Vikings "wind up" on beat 1, flash red on beat 2, and strike on beat 3.

## 7. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Goals

For the prototype, we focus on the **"Tightness" of the Rhythm Loop**.

1.  **The "Strict" Input Engine:**
    *   Implement the ±0.15s grace window.
    *   Implement the "Stumble" state for off-beat inputs.
2.  **The "Field Scribe" Controller:**
    *   Movement (WASD) vs. Writing (Root + Buttons).
    *   The "Ink Dash" ability.
3.  **Item State Logic:**
    *   Pickup/Drop logic changes the player's HUD.
    *   Implement "Ink Slick" physics when a pot is dropped.
4.  **Basic Light/Dark Loop:**
    *   Bool check: `IsPlayerInLight?` If False, block "Write Mode."

### Cut Content (Saved for Post-Prototype)
*   **Complex Liturgies:** Removed the complex spell-casting system. The Scribe's only active ability is "Write" and "Dash." (Keep it simple).
*   **Wall Destruction:** The room geometry remains static.
